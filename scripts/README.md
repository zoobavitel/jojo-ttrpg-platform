# scripts/

This directory contains various shell scripts used for automating common development, deployment, and setup tasks for the 1-800-BIZARRE platform. These scripts are designed to streamline workflows and ensure consistency across different environments.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this directory is to:
*   **Automate Repetitive Tasks**: Provide single commands to execute complex sequences of operations, such as deploying the application or setting up the development environment.
*   **Standardize Workflows**: Ensure that common procedures are performed consistently by all developers and in automated environments (e.g., CI/CD).
*   **Simplify Operations**: Reduce the manual effort and potential for human error in critical processes like deployment.

## Key Contents

*   `deploy-prod.sh`: A shell script likely responsible for deploying the application to a production environment. This script would typically handle building the frontend, collecting static files for the backend, running database migrations, and restarting services.
*   `production-deployment-checklist.sh`: A script that might outline or automate a checklist of tasks to be performed before or during a production deployment, ensuring all necessary steps are covered.
*   `setup.sh`: A script for initial project setup, which could include installing dependencies for both frontend and backend, setting up environment variables, and performing initial database migrations.

## Code Quality and Structure

Placing utility scripts in a dedicated `scripts/` directory is a common and effective practice. This organization ensures:
*   **Discoverability**: Scripts are easily found and understood as operational tools.
*   **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps automation logic separate from application source code.
*   **Reusability**: Scripts can be called from various contexts (e.g., local development, CI/CD pipelines).

## Logic Behind Decisions

The decision to centralize operational scripts in the `scripts/` directory is driven by the need for efficient and reliable project management. Automating deployment and setup processes is crucial for reducing errors and accelerating development cycles. These scripts act as a form of executable documentation for critical operational procedures, ensuring that the project can be consistently set up and deployed by anyone involved.

**Note on "Logic Behind Decisions"**: The explanations regarding decision logic primarily reflect discussions from the current chat session and general software engineering best practices. This document does not have access to the full history of all previous, unlogged interactions or design discussions that may have influenced the project's evolution.
