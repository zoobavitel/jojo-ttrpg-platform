# JoJo TTRPG - Dynamic Ability Management System
## Implementation Complete ✅

### 📋 Overview
The dynamic ability management system has been successfully implemented, allowing users to manage different types of abilities based on their selected playbook. This provides a seamless way to switch between Standard, Hamon, and Spin abilities through a unified interface.

### 🎯 Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Backend Infrastructure ✅
- **API Endpoints**: Added `/api/hamon-abilities/` and `/api/spin-abilities/`
- **Models**: HamonAbility and SpinAbility models (already existed)
- **Serializers**: HamonAbilitySerializer and SpinAbilitySerializer
- **ViewSets**: HamonAbilityViewSet and SpinAbilityViewSet
- **Data**: Loaded 12 Hamon abilities and 10 Spin abilities from fixtures

#### 2. Frontend Dynamic System ✅
- **State Management**: Added `abilityPanelType` to track current selection
- **API Integration**: Fetch abilities from backend with fallback data
- **Dynamic Dropdown**: Ability panel options adapt to selected playbook
- **Auto-switching**: Panel automatically switches when playbook changes
- **Unified Interface**: Consistent checkbox interface across all ability types

#### 3. Character Data Structure ✅
- **Extended Model**: Added `hamonAbilities` and `spinAbilities` arrays
- **Persistence**: Save/load includes new ability fields
- **Display Logic**: Ability counting includes all types

#### 4. Helper Functions ✅
- `getAvailableAbilities()`: Returns appropriate ability set based on panel type
- `getCharacterAbilities()`: Gets character's abilities for current panel type
- `updateCharacterAbilities()`: Updates character's abilities for current panel type
- `getAbilityPanelOptions()`: Returns available panel options based on playbook

### 🧪 Test Results

- ✅ Dynamic dropdown implementation verified
- ✅ Auto-switching logic implemented
- ✅ State management code confirmed

### 🎮 User Experience

#### For Hamon Users:
1. Set playbook to "Hamon"
2. Navigate to Abilities panel
3. Click "Manage" button
4. Dropdown shows: "Standard Abilities" and "Hamon Abilities"
5. Select "Hamon Abilities" to see 12 unique Hamon techniques
6. Selected abilities are stored in `character.hamonAbilities`

#### For Spin Users:

- Could be extended later for Stand-specific abilities

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

#### Backend Files Modified:
- `/backend/src/characters/serializers.py` - Added HamonAbility and SpinAbility serializers
- `/backend/src/characters/views.py` - Added HamonAbility and SpinAbility ViewSets
- `/backend/src/app/urls.py` - Added API endpoint registrations

#### Frontend Files Modified:
- `/frontend/src/components/CharacterSheet.jsx` - Major updates for dynamic ability management

#### Key Code Features:
```javascript
// Dynamic ability panel options based on playbook
const getAbilityPanelOptions = () => {
  const options = [{ value: 'standard', label: 'Standard Abilities' }];
  
  if (character.playbook === 'Hamon') {
    options.push({ value: 'hamon', label: 'Hamon Abilities' });
  } else if (character.playbook === 'Spin') {
    options.push({ value: 'spin', label: 'Spin Abilities' });
  }
  
  return options;
};

// Auto-switching when playbook changes
useEffect(() => {
  if (character.playbook === 'Hamon' && gameState.abilityPanelType !== 'hamon') {
    setGameState(prev => ({ ...prev, abilityPanelType: 'hamon' }));
  } else if (character.playbook === 'Spin' && gameState.abilityPanelType !== 'spin') {
    setGameState(prev => ({ ...prev, abilityPanelType: 'spin' }));
  } else if (!['Hamon', 'Spin'].includes(character.playbook) && gameState.abilityPanelType !== 'standard') {
    setGameState(prev => ({ ...prev, abilityPanelType: 'standard' }));
  }
}, [character.playbook, gameState.abilityPanelType]);
```
