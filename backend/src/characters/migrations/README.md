# backend/src/characters/migrations/

This directory contains Django migration files for the `characters` application. Migrations are Django's way of propagating changes you make to your models (adding a field, deleting a model, etc.) into your database schema.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this directory is to:
*   **Track Database Schema Changes**: Store a history of modifications made to the database models, allowing for version control of the database schema.
*   **Apply Schema Updates**: Enable the application of these changes to the database using Django's `migrate` command.
*   **Ensure Database Consistency**: Provide a reliable mechanism for evolving the database schema across different development environments and in production.

## Key Contents

*   `0001_initial.py`: The first migration file, typically generated when the application is initially created, defining the initial database tables based on the `models.py`.
*   `0002_*.py`, `0003_*.py`, etc.: Subsequent migration files, each representing a set of changes to the database schema. The filenames are prefixed with a sequential number for ordering.
*   `__init__.py`: Marks the directory as a Python package.
*   `__pycache__/`: Contains compiled Python bytecode files.

## Code Quality and Structure

This structure is a fundamental part of Django's ORM and database management. It ensures:
*   **Reliable Schema Evolution**: Changes to the database are applied in a controlled and versioned manner.
*   **Collaboration**: Developers can work on different features that modify the database, and their changes can be merged and applied systematically.
*   **Reproducibility**: The database schema can be recreated at any point in its history.

## Logic Behind Decisions

The decision to use Django's built-in migration system is a standard and highly recommended practice for any Django project. It automates the often complex process of database schema management, reducing the risk of errors and ensuring consistency across different environments. Each migration file represents a deliberate change to the database structure, reflecting the evolution of the game's data model over time.

**Note on "Logic Behind Decisions"**: The explanations regarding decision logic primarily reflect discussions from the current chat session and general software engineering best practices. This document does not have access to the full history of all previous, unlogged interactions or design discussions that may have influenced the project's evolution.
