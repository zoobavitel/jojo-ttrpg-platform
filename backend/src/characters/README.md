# backend/src/characters/

This directory contains the `characters` Django application, which is the core of the Jojo TTRPG Platform's backend. It defines and manages all game-specific entities and their associated business logic, including characters, campaigns, NPCs, abilities, and the rules governing their interactions.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this application is to:
*   **Model Game Entities**: Define the database schemas (models) for all core game components.
*   **Implement Game Logic**: House the business rules and validation for character creation, advancement, game mechanics, and inter-entity relationships.
*   **Provide API Endpoints**: Expose RESTful API views for CRUD operations and custom actions related to game entities.
*   **Manage Data Fixtures**: Store initial data or test data in JSON format for various game elements.
*   **Handle Migrations**: Track changes to the database schema over time.
*   **Contain Management Commands**: Provide custom Django management commands for administrative tasks specific to game data.

## Key Contents

*   `models.py`: Defines the Django models for `Character`, `Stand`, `Campaign`, `Crew`, `NPC`, `Heritage`, `Ability`, `Vice`, `Trauma`, and related junction tables. This is where the core data structure of the game is established.
*   `serializers.py`: Defines how complex data types (like Django model instances) are converted to and from Python native datatypes, which can then be easily rendered into JSON, XML, or other content types. This is crucial for API interactions with the frontend, and also where much of the data validation logic resides.
*   `views.py`: Defines the logic for handling HTTP requests and returning HTTP responses. These views would typically expose the API endpoints for character management, and may include custom actions like character creation guides, action rolls, and crew name consensus.
*   `admin.py`: Registers the models with the Django admin interface, allowing for easy management of game data through a web-based GUI.
*   `apps.py`: Django application configuration.
*   `__init__.py`: Marks the directory as a Python package.
*   `fixtures/`: Contains JSON files with initial data for various game elements, often derived from the SRD (e.g., `srd_benefits.json`, `standard_abilities.json`).
*   `migrations/`: Stores database schema migration files generated by Django, tracking changes to `models.py`.
*   `management/`: Contains custom Django management commands.
*   `tests/`: Houses unit and integration tests for the models, serializers, and views within this application, ensuring the correctness and adherence to game rules.
*   `__pycache__/`: Contains compiled Python bytecode files.

## Code Quality and Structure

This application adheres to Django's best practices for structuring a reusable app:
*   **Cohesion**: All code related to game entities and their logic is encapsulated within this single app.
*   **Modularity**: The app can theoretically be reused in other Django projects (though tightly coupled to the Jojo TTRPG rules).
*   **Clear Responsibilities**: `models.py` for data, `serializers.py` for data representation and validation, `views.py` for API logic, and `tests/` for verification.

## Logic Behind Decisions

The decision to create a dedicated `characters` Django app is fundamental to the project's architecture. It centralizes all game-specific logic, making it easier to manage, test, and extend. The separation of concerns within the app (models, serializers, views) follows Django REST Framework's recommended patterns, promoting clean code and maintainability. The use of fixtures for SRD data ensures consistent game rules across environments.
