The most complex shape GULP can form is a humanoid hand. The quality and durability of objects formed from GULP are based on a durability check.",

  "stand_description": "GULP is a 32oz glass bottle that has the word GULP painted in gold on the side. By pouring the oil from the bottle, the stand is activated. This ability works [range and scope based on stand coin]. When dispensed, the viscous oil can change it's viscosity and density, becoming solidified, liquified, or vaporized. The state of matter that GULP appears in is manipulated by a dial on the bottle. However, if Slick Rick is not in possession of the bottle, all of the oil will return to the source. The ability can be used to reduce friction between objects, increase friction between objects, as an adhesive, as a putty, or even as an extra hand if Slick Rick passes a precision check.",
