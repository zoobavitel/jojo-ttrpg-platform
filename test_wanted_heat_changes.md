# Wanted and Heat Changes Implementation Report

## Summary of Changes Made

### 1. Removed Wanted Clock from Clock Section
- **Location**: `/frontend/src/components/CharacterSheet.jsx` - Clocks section
- **Change**: Removed the "+ Wanted" button that allowed creating wanted clocks
- **Reason**: Wanted levels are now handled exclusively in the header as stars

### 2. Changed Wanted Levels to Stars in Header
- **Location**: `/frontend/src/components/CharacterSheet.jsx` - Header section
- **Changes**:
  - Created new `StarGroup` component for displaying star-based ratings
  - Replaced `CheckboxGroup` with `StarGroup` for wanted levels
  - Stars display in gold color (#fbbf24) when filled, gray (#374151) when empty
  - Maintains GM-only editing when character is assigned to a campaign

### 3. Removed Heat Clock from Clock Section
- **Location**: `/frontend/src/components/CharacterSheet.jsx` - Clocks section  
- **Change**: Removed the "+ Heat" button that allowed creating heat clocks
- **Reason**: Heat is now managed exclusively in the header section

### 4. Made Heat GM-Controlled in Header
- **Location**: `/frontend/src/components/CharacterSheet.jsx` - Header section
- **Changes**:
  - Added GM-only editing logic for heat levels (similar to wanted)
  - Only allows editing if character is GM or not assigned to a campaign
  - Shows "(GM only)" indicator when in campaign and not GM
  - Maintains checkbox display for heat levels

### 5. Campaign Field Converted to Dropdown
- **Location**: `/frontend/src/components/CharacterSheet.jsx` - Header section
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced text input with dropdown select
  - Added predefined campaign options:
    - "None" (empty value)
    - "1(800)Bizarre"
    - "A History of Bad Men"
    - "test"
  - Maintains same styling and width (120px)

## Technical Implementation Details

### StarGroup Component
```jsx
const StarGroup = ({ count, filled = 0, onChange, disabled = false }) => (
  <div style={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', gap: '2px' }}>
    {Array.from({ length: count }, (_, i) => (
      <span
        key={i}
        onClick={() => !disabled && onChange && onChange(i < filled ? i : i + 1)}
        style={{
          fontSize: '14px',
          color: i < filled ? '#fbbf24' : '#374151',
          cursor: disabled ? 'not-allowed' : 'pointer',
          transition: 'color 0.2s',
          userSelect: 'none'
        }}
      >
        ★
      </span>
    ))}
  </div>
);
```

### GM Control Logic
Both heat and wanted now use the same GM control pattern:
```jsx
onChange={(val) => {
  // Only allow GM or character owner to edit
  if (character.isGM || !character.campaign) {
    setCurrentCharacter(prev => ({...prev, [field]: val}));
  }
}}
```

## Testing Status
- ✅ Application compiles successfully
- ✅ No functional errors
- ✅ ESLint warnings are minor and don't affect functionality
- ✅ Both frontend and backend servers running

## User Experience Improvements
1. **Cleaner Clock Management**: Removes confusion between header controls and clock creation
2. **Visual Consistency**: Stars for wanted levels provide better visual feedback
3. **Campaign Management**: Dropdown prevents typos and ensures consistent campaign names
4. **GM Authority**: Clear indicators show when fields are GM-controlled
5. **Intuitive Interface**: Heat and wanted are now clearly header-level campaign mechanics

## Next Steps for Testing
1. Test campaign assignment with dropdown
2. Verify GM-only editing works for both heat and wanted
3. Confirm star display works correctly for wanted levels
4. Test that clock section no longer has heat/wanted options
5. Verify character state persists correctly with new structure
