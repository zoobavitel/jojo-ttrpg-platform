# frontend/src/

This directory contains the core source code for the React frontend application. It is where all the components, styles, and application logic reside, forming the user interface of the Jojo TTRPG Platform.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this directory is to:
*   **Develop React Components**: House all reusable UI components that make up the application's interface.
*   **Implement Application Logic**: Contain the JavaScript/TypeScript code that defines the behavior and state management of the frontend.
*   **Manage Styles**: Organize CSS or other styling solutions used to visually design the application.
*   **Define Entry Point**: Include the main entry file (e.g., `main.jsx` or `index.jsx`) that bootstraps the React application.

## Key Contents

*   `Character.jsx`: A React component likely responsible for rendering and managing the character sheet, including displaying character data and handling user interactions for character updates.
*   `Home.jsx`: A React component likely representing the main landing page or dashboard of the application.
*   Other `.jsx` or `.tsx` files: (Not explicitly listed, but typically present) Additional React components for various parts of the UI (e.g., navigation, forms, data display).
*   CSS/SCSS/Tailwind CSS files: (Not explicitly listed, but typically present) Styling definitions for the components and overall application layout.

## Code Quality and Structure

This directory follows a component-based architecture, which is a best practice for React applications. This promotes:
*   **Modularity**: Each component is self-contained and responsible for a specific part of the UI.
*   **Reusability**: Components can be easily reused across different parts of the application.
*   **Maintainability**: Changes to one part of the UI are isolated to its respective component, reducing the risk of unintended side effects.
*   **Testability**: Individual components can be tested in isolation.

## Logic Behind Decisions

The decision to structure the frontend using React components within the `src/` directory aligns with modern web development practices. This approach facilitates the creation of complex and interactive user interfaces by breaking them down into smaller, manageable pieces. The use of JSX (or TSX) allows for a declarative way to describe UI, making the code more readable and maintainable. The organization within `src/` reflects a commitment to clean code and efficient development workflows.

**Note on "Logic Behind Decisions"**: The explanations regarding decision logic primarily reflect discussions from the current chat session and general software engineering best practices. This document does not have access to the full history of all previous, unlogged interactions or design discussions that may have influenced the project's evolution.
