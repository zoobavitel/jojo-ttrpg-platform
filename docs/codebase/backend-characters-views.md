# Characters app — views package (`backend/src/characters/views/`)

Modular DRF views; **[`__init__.py`](../../backend/src/characters/views/__init__.py)** re-exports all symbols so [app/urls.py](../../backend/src/app/urls.py) can `from characters.views import ...` from a single namespace.

There is no sibling `characters/views.py` module — the **`views/` package** is the only import path (legacy monolith removed; it incorrectly folded attribute rating into action-roll pools).

**Router prefix:** All registered routes live under `/api/` (see [backend-app.md](backend-app.md)).
