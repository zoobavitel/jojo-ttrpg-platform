# Management commands

**Run management commands from** `backend/src/` **with venv active:**

```bash
cd backend/src && python manage.py <command_name>
```

Shell backup: [scripts/backup-database.sh](../../scripts/backup-database.sh). Narrative: [scripts.md](scripts.md). Django command `backup_database` delegates to that script.

**Category legend**

- **Operational:** Safe-ish introspection or admin fixes; still run only with understanding.
- **Seed:** Generic test/demo data.
- **Content:** Named demo/NPC scenarios; often one-off for a table or story.

For exact arguments, read each file’s `add_arguments` and `handle` docstrings.

**Ad-hoc Python in `backend/src/` root:** Legacy one-off scripts were removed; use the table above or shell helpers in [`scripts/`](../../scripts/) (see [scripts.md](scripts.md)).

**Other apps:** `authentication/`, `campaigns/`, `crews/`, `factions/` exist under `backend/src/` with their own `models`/`views` — smaller than `characters`. Explore before relying on them in production; main product API is `characters` + `app.urls`.
