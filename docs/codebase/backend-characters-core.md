# Characters app — core (`backend/src/characters/`)

Primary Django app: ORM models, DRF serializers, parsers, admin, and service helpers. URL routing lives in [`app/urls.py`](../../backend/src/app/urls.py) (see [backend-app.md](backend-app.md)). API views live under the [`views/`](../../backend/src/characters/views/) package (see [backend-characters-views.md](backend-characters-views.md)).

---

## [apps.py](../../backend/src/characters/apps.py)

Standard `AppConfig` with `name = 'characters'`.

---

## [models.py](../../backend/src/characters/models.py)

## [serializers.py](../../backend/src/characters/serializers.py)

DRF `ModelSerializer` and a few `Serializer` classes for nested updates (user profile, passwords, session NPC involvement, character payloads). Aligns with ViewSets in `views/*.py`: exposes nested crew/playbook data, session votes, character JSON fields, image uploads, etc. Large file; new endpoints usually add or extend serializers here.

---

## [views/](../../backend/src/characters/views/)

**Role:** Package of DRF viewsets and function views registered in [urls.py](../../backend/src/app/urls.py). Import via `from characters.views import …` (`views/__init__.py` re-exports). Detailed map: [backend-characters-views.md](backend-characters-views.md).

---

## [parsers.py](../../backend/src/characters/parsers.py)

**`MultipartJsonParser`:** Extends DRF `MultiPartParser` to `json.loads` string values that look like JSON objects/arrays so `JSONField` and nested payloads work with multipart file uploads (e.g. character sheet images + JSON stats).

---

## [admin.py](../../backend/src/characters/admin.py)

Registers `Heritage` (with benefit/detriment inlines), `Character`, `NPC`, and related models for Django admin (`list_display`, `fieldsets`, filters).

---

## [services/character_service.py](../../backend/src/characters/services/character_service.py)

**`CharacterService`:** Static helpers for dice/outcome helpers, vice indulgence, harm/heal stubs, XP — used to centralize mechanics-oriented logic (may be partially illustrative vs fully wired to views).

---

## [services/campaign_service.py](../../backend/src/characters/services/campaign_service.py)

**`CampaignService`:** Static helpers for creating campaigns, listing user campaigns, edit permissions (GM/staff), attaching characters, NPC visibility rules for non-GMs.

---

## [services/__init__.py](../../backend/src/characters/services/__init__.py)

Package marker for business-logic services (`character_service`, `campaign_service`).
